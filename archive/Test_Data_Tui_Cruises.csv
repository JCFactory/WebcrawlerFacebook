I separate garbage 😊
My family and I only eat vegan and go sailing instead of cruising. 😍
How ridiculous are these measures? Cruise ships are not environmentally friendly!
These activities are really not worth mentioning. Cruises should be banned. 
We don't travel far for our holidays and are not going on any cruise ships☹️
I hate cruise ships! 🤬
We only use green electricity at home 
Thank you for taking such measurements 😍
The ideas are good, the implementation comes much too late. Cruises are not environmentally friendly.
You cannot compensate your CO2 emissions with such ridiculous measures. 😡🤬
Cruise is the very last thing I would do. I only sail sail. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Your food is good, but you throw away so much food and still use way too much plastic. 
It was a chaos at the travel agency and a couple suites we wanted were already sold out in a few minutes. But i am glad we eventually have booked 2 great cruises for 2021😁 can’t wait!
Too bad, such an expensive trip and then we were so disappointed! What are paper straws for? I don't think that should happen with such a renowned company!
I'm not going on another cruise until it's possible without heavy fuel....
Great 👍 looking forward to the next trip in January 2021
Super, super, super!!!!
Great thing!! Keep it up. 🍨⛱🌊🍹⛴🍾🍦☕😎
You can also overdo it with certain measures. Only a few ecofreaks are going crazy right now.
I find avoidance of plastic garbage good 👍 but to eat the 🍧 ice cream sundae at the pool with wooden spoons did not taste to us unfortunately... you mainly taste the wood 
The cane paper straws are better than the paper straws you had before. You really don't notice any difference to the plastic parts 👍
The app keeps crashing when I want to book. Fucking Lachmann Cruises. Then I book somewhere else. 🤬
PLEASE use environmentally friendly fuels very soon, otherwise your use is ridiculous.
Think of the CO2 emissions!!!!
Haha, greenwashing at the cruise shipping company?! When everyone knows that ecologically there is hardly a bigger sacrilege.
Super 👍👍👍👍
That's a very good start! But there is even more. Why butter without one-way packaging?
We had a great holiday on board and can recommend Lachmann Cruises! 
Continue like this. The holiday with Lachmann Cruises is great 😍😍
After already 14 trips I have to state that more and more the price screw is turned and the trips become much more expensive. Unfortunately the service and the quality don't increase. Rip-off!
Anticipation is quickly burst 🤬 Suddenly twice as expensive.
Peter Müller?
Hannelore Schmidt. We have to go on board!
Lena Behnke – next year??? ❤️
Sascha Wild – we have to check this cruise line 
Hans Glück ❤️
